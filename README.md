# Pyorea
Write React applications using Python

With this unholy abomination, write React components in python, which gets interpreted by Cpython embedded in the webpage

# How it works
Internally this library loads [*Pyodide*](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) and executes the python code in the webpage along with few conveniences
  * NPM libraries loading via [*ESM CDN*](https://esm.sh/)
  * Easy React DSL to be used from python
